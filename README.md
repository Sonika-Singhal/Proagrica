Adaptris  Technical test

## Solution
* Downloaded and installed Interlok software.
* Configured Interlok to create channel, workflow, consumer/producer connections and log service.
* Added a test file 'Exercise_InputFile.txt' in 'messages/in' folder (consumer). The file got moved to 'messages/out' folder with the same name and content.
* Log service component printed the content of input file in Adapter console log.

## Files included
### adapter.xml
Project configuration file

### adapter.log
Console log for the test

### Exercise_InputFile.txt
Test file for the exercise

## Feedback
* Software installation is quite straightforward. Followed the instructions on the recommended resources and it just worked as expected.
* It took some time to hang of the software how it works. YouTube videos were quite useful for product understanding.
* Once I understood how it works, it was quite easy to add/remove components to try various built in configurations.
* Some of the components look very similar but was unable to distinguish the difference eg FS and FileSystem components.
